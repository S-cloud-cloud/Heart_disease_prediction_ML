# Heart_disease_prediction_Model_ML
Heart disease exploratory analysis and prediction model  using ML concepts and Logistic regression algorithm in R language.The model makes an analysis of carefully 
selected features from the dataset (that was first cleaned,transformed in binary classification and vizualized accordingly ) that are the causes 
behind a heart disease and then performs an exploratory analysis of all the predicators and shows result in box plot graphs.After that the data is splitted in 75% training &
25% testing to develop the model,further Logistic regression algo was applied on the training datast , cross-fold-validation and testing of prediction by the model on training
data was found out to calcutate missclassification errors based on parameters and concept of confusion matrix.
Our model proved to be a good classifier with an AUC value around 85%.
